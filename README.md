# levup

The following Readme is under construction.

Welcome to your new levup project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity levups.

To learn more before you start working with levup, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd levup/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor


# Charge the Canister

1. Check canister ID:

```
dfx canister id levup
```

2. Save canister ID into a command line variable:

```
CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister id levup )\""
```

3. Check canister ID has been successfully saved:

```
echo $CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY

```

# Deploy the Project to the Live IC Network

Create and deploy canisters:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

Check the live canister ID:

```
dfx canister --network ic id levup
```

Save the live canister ID to a command line variable:

```
LIVE_CANISTER_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister --network ic id levup )\""

```

Get live canister front-end id:

```
dfx canister --network ic id levup_assets
```



   dfx deploy --argument null internet_identity

   dfx deploy levup
